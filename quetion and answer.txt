> select sum(od.quantity * p.price) as total_sales from order_details od join pizzas p using(pizza_id);

3.Identify the highest-priced pizza.
>  select * from pizzas order by price desc limit 1;

4.Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
> select p.size, count(o.order_details_id) from pizzas p join order_details o using(pizza_id) group by p.size order by p.size desc limit 1;

5.List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
> select p.name, sum(quantity) as quantity from pizza_types p join pizzas pz using(pizza_type_id) join order_details using(pizza_id) group by p.name order by quantity desc limit 5;

Intermediate:

1.Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
> select pz.category, sum(o.quantity) as total_quantity from pizza_types pz join pizzas p using(pizza_type_id) join order_details o using(pizza_id) group by pz.category;

2.Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day
> select hour(time), count(order_id) from orders group by hour(time) ;

3.Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
> select category, count(name) from pizza_types group by category;

4.Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
> select pizza_types.name, sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue from pizza_types join pizzas on pizzas.pizza_type_id = pizza_types.pizza_type_id join order_details on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id group by pizza_types.name order by revenue desc limit 3;

Advanced:

1.Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
>select pizza_types.category, round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) / (select round(sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price), 2) as total_sales from order_details join pizzas on pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id) *100,2) as revenue from pizza_types join pizzas on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id join order_details on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id group by pizza_types.category order by revenue desc;

2.analyz the cumulative revenue generated over time.
> .select date, sum(revenue) over (order by date) as cum_revenue from (select orders.date, sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue from order_details join pizzas on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id join orders on orders.order_id = order_details.order_id group by orders.date) as sales;

3.Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
> select name, revenue from (select category, name, revenue, rank() over (partition by category order by revenue desc) as rn from (select pizza_types.category, pizza_types.name, sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as revenue from pizza_types join pizzas using(pizza_type_id) join order_details using(pizza_id) group by pizza_types.category, pizza_types.name) as aj) as b where rn < 3;
